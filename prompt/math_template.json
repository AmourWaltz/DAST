                "answer": "For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must \"meet\" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\\boxed{0}$."

                "question": "A rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",
                "answer": "Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\\boxed{98}$."

We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial."

                "answer": "Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 20 \\\\\n60x - 30y &= 660 \\\\\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\\boxed{6}$ days."

                "answer": "First we'll simplify that complicated expression. We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \\begin{align*}\npq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\\\\n&= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\\\\n&= q(p+3)(q+p).\n\\end{align*}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator.  We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \\neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \\geq 0$ so that $p + q \\neq 0.$\n\nAlso because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides. This gives  \\begin{align*}\n3(p+3)&>2p^2\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3p+9&>2p^2 \\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&>2p^2-3p-9.\n\\end{align*}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality. We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \\leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\\boxed{[0,3)}$."
